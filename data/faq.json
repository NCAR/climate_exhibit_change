The natural global carbon cycle includes the exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) between the land, ocean, and atmosphere. Before the Industrial Revolution, the amount of CO2 in the air remained relatively stable for thousands of years. Over the last 100-plus years, humans have been burning carbon-based fuels for the majority of their energy needs, such as heating, cooling, lighting, and transportation. Burning fossil fuels releases more CO2 into the atmosphere that would otherwise be stored in soils and buried underground. Therefore, more carbon dioxide is now entering the air than leaving it, resulting in the highest concentration of atmospheric CO2 in at least one million years.</p>",

Thousands of independent scientists and research centers around the world, including NCAR, have found through rigorous scientific investigations that climate change is occurring. We have known for more than a century that greenhouse gases warm the climate, and there is no evidence that the bulk of recent climate change is somehow unrelated to fossil fuel burning.</p>",

Over the last century, there have been several speedups and slowdowns in global atmospheric warming, but the overall trend has still been upward.  Even a whole century’s worth of warming can be considered “rapid” when you look at how climate has progressed over many thousands of years. Physical clues, such as air bubbles trapped in ice, tell us that the rate of warming over the last few decades is much greater than the pace of other major warming events in Earth’s climate history.</p>",

The total energy of the Sun varies over an 11-year cycle, but only by about a tenth of one percent. During the last few decades, there has been virtually no change in the total output of the Sun. Still, Earth’s atmosphere and oceans have warmed up significantly. In fact, the 11-year solar cycle was close to its minimum in 2010, yet Earth’s surface temperature set a record high that same year. Another clue: land surface temperatures and night temperatures are also warming. These combined observed effects in temperature warming in the troposphere are exactly what we would expect to happen with increased greenhouse gases.</p>",

Scientists monitor both natural and human activities by collecting data with satellite- and land-based instruments all around the globe.

The ‘ozone hole’ refers to a thinning of this protective layer, a depletion that occurs above Antarctica for a few weeks each year. A less severe depletion has been observed above much of the planet. The ozone hole is due to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that were formerly used in aerosol spray cans, refrigerators, and air conditioners. These stable molecules remain in the air for many years, and they can react with other molecules in sunlight on very cold, high-altitude polar clouds to eventually break down ozone molecules. Fortunately, the world’s nations agreed to ban CFC gases in the late 1980s, and the ozone hole has since begun to slowly recover. Without this protective layer, a much larger amount of dangerous ultraviolet radiation would reach people, plants, and animals.</p>",

Such changes affect the amount and timing of sunlight reaching the Northern Hemisphere. During an ice age, polar ice sheets grow and persist for many thousands of years. Their bright surfaces reflect sunlight and cool the planet. In between the ice ages, there are warmer interglacial periods that are often triggered by more summer sunlight reaching the Northern Hemisphere. The current interglacial period has lasted more than 10,000 years. The consensus among climate scientists is that it will continue, with no ice age around the corner. In fact, greenhouse gases and associated warming are already melting large amounts of ice over parts of Antarctica and Greenland. Our current interglacial period is expected to last at least 50,000 years, and it may extend for another 100,000 years or more because of carbon dioxide emissions from human activities leading to global temperature warming. An ice age would have many serious impacts on society and ecosystems. However, climate warming, due to increased greenhouse gases, has its own serious risks and hazards.</p>",

Even a small change in global average temperature can have a noticeable impact on weather patterns, plants, animals, oceans, and people around the world. We’ve already increased global air temperatures by close to 1.8°F over the last century, and this temperature increase has caused measurable impacts on every continent and in every ocean. Some parts of the world, such as high-latitude and high-elevation regions, are warming even faster than the global average. A shift in a degree or two may not seem very significant to our human skin, but the planet responds in more dramatic ways.</p><p>For example, the average temperature in the U.S. capitol of Washington, D.C., is only about 4°F warmer than in Boston, but Washington has many more 90°F and 100°F days. Heat waves are already becoming more frequent and intense across the nation. Around 6,000 year ago, the western interior of the United States was less than 2°F (or 1°C) cooler, but it was largely a desert due to prolonged drought conditions. Trees accustomed to a particular climate, such as the sugar maples of New England, may suffer or die out with only a small amount of long-term warming. Pine beetle infestations have increased due to warming temperatures, and widespread outbreaks have decimated tree populations across the Rocky Mountain Region. Temperature change, even in small amounts, is serious business.</p><p>The goal of the Paris Agreement, produced in 2015 by the world’s nations, is to limit warming over the next century to no more than a 3.6°F increase above preindustrial conditions. Even this amount of warming could require major changes to where and how we grow crops, how we protect our coastal cities from rising seas, how we manage our water resources, and how we deal with fire-prone forests. If global temperatures warm beyond the goal of the Paris Agreement, then even more adaptation will be required.</p>",

Second, as the temperature of the air warms, it continues to melt snow and ice on land, sending meltwater into the oceans. These two processes have forced the average global sea level to rise by about 8 inches over the last century. The pace of the rise has been about 50% faster since the 1990s. How much more the sea level rises this century will depend on how much greenhouse gases are emitted and how much the temperature continues to warm. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts between 1 to 3 feet of sea level rise by the end of the century, but recent research suggests it could rise by as much as 6 feet if Antarctic ice sheets are destabilized. Millions of people living near the coasts of the U.S. are highly vulnerable to sea level rise and its devastating impacts, including more frequent flooding and more destructive storm surges. Already, places such as Norfolk, Virginia, and Miami Beach, Florida, are having increasing problems with recurrent flooding. In some areas, the coastal landscape is subsiding, which raises the risk of future flooding even more. Around the world, tropical islands are severely threatened by sea level rise, with many villages already underwater.</p>",

There will always be hot and cold days in the short term and from season to season, while global warming is the long-term warming trend. As the Earth continues to warm, record high temperatures will become more frequent and record lows less frequent.  Already, the U.S. has had two to three times more daily record highs than daily record lows in recent years. Climate change also increases the frequency and/or intensity of some types of extreme weather, including heat waves and heavy rains. The strongest hurricanes are becoming more frequent, and warmer temperatures are worsening the impact of droughts. A warmer atmosphere and warmer oceans mean that more water vapor enters the air—which means that although winters may become less intense over the long term, a particular snowstorm could be stronger due to the extra water vapor in the air.</p>",

Some plants and animals, especially many insects and pests, are well adapted to a wide range of conditions. Others, like large mammals and small amphibians, live within a specific habitat and depend on a narrower range of climate conditions. As temperatures and rainfall patterns change, plants and animals respond, and sometimes not very well. Some plants and animals are already shifting toward cooler locations at higher latitudes or elevations. Many plants and animals can only move so far, however, as their habitats disappear, corridors are blocked by development, and cooler places become harder to find. For example, polar bears have to swim farther in search of food as sea ice melts, and birds are migrating farther toward the poles as temperatures warm. Spring is coming earlier each year in many places, but some flowers are blooming out of sync with migrating pollinators.</p><p>Unfortunately, many of the species that will benefit from climate change are invasive and destructive. Plant-killing pests can reproduce more quickly in a warming climate, and weeds can proliferate. As plants and animals move or die, ecosystems unravel. Recent studies suggest that one in six species are at risk of extinction by the end of the century, and climate change could possibly lead to the sixth mass extinction in Earth’s history if nothing is done to stop global warming.</p>",

The leading cause of current climate change is too much carbon dioxide in the air, which traps heat and warms the planet. The main reason why temperatures won’t just go back to normal even if we stop emitting carbon dioxide (CO2) is because most of the CO2 that we have already emitted will stay in the atmosphere for centuries. Even thousands of years from now, up to 20% of the CO2 that we emit today may still be in the air, warming the Earth. If we do nothing about lowering current CO2 emissions, then the climate may be warmer and more unpredictable for our children and grandchildren than we have ever seen before.

The second-best car is a hybrid: they are generally more efficient than a typical gasoline car, thanks to the extra power they get storing energy from the car’s brakes. There are also plug-in hybrids that allow you to use electricity for short trips while having a hybrid gas engine for longer trips. If an electric or hybrid car is not an option, then driving a fuel-efficient smaller car is the next-best choice. The most climate-unfriendly car to drive is any vehicle with low gas mileage. If an SUV is a must, try a hybrid version. If you have an older vehicle that gets good gas mileage, try keeping it as long as possible to reduce the amount of energy used to manufacture cars.

China is working to build a national carbon market and leads the world in implementing solar energy technologies at a national scale. European nations are scaling up renewables like wind energy.
